When to use Python?
Python is a pretty versatile language. For which applications can you use Python?

a) You want to do some quick calculations.
b) For your new business, you want to develop a database-driven website.
c) Your boss asks you to clean and analyze the results of the latest satisfaction survey.
d) All of the above.

Solution : d(All of the above.)

Excercise 3:

Any comments?
Something that Filip didn't mention in his videos is that you can add comments to your Python scripts. Comments are important to make sure that you and others can understand what your code is about.

To add comments to your Python script, you can use the # tag. These comments are not run as Python code, so they will not influence your result. As an example, take the comment on the right, # Division; it is completely ignored during execution.

Solution : 
````
# Division
print(5 / 8)

# Addition
print(7 + 10)

````

Python as a calculator
Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. Apart from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, there is also support for more advanced operations such as:

Exponentiation: **. This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. For example 4**2 will give 16.
Modulo: %. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right. For example 18 % 7 equals 4.
The code in the script on the right gives some examples.
Instructions : 
Suppose you have $100, which you can invest with a 10% return each year. After one year, it's 100×1.1=110 dollars, and after two years it's 100×1.1×1.1=121. Add code on the right to calculate how much money you end up with after 7 years.

Solution : 
````
# Addition, subtraction
print(5 + 5)
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation
print(3 * 5)
print(10 / 2)
print(18 % 7)
print(4 ** 2)

# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?
print(100*1.1**7)
